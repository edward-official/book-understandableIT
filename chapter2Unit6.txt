back in the days, there were a lot of different operating systems.
so languages were diverse too.
because of that, fixing bugs was really an exhausting task.
in this situation, java poped out.
they designed JVM for each of the operating systems.
thanks to this, we don't have to consider about the operating system when we code.

but one problem is that it's relatively slow.
and this makes it hard to be used on the mobile environment.
(mobile devices have less storage and inferior performance)
