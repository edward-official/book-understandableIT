even non-majored workers in software companies have to understand some IT knowledge for communication with developers

for example...

Planner:
I think users should be able to change that color!
This part is kind of urgent!

Developer:
Ah... that’s a bit complicated...
If it’s urgent, I can temporarily store the color info in the class.
Can I work on the server and DB later?
Changing all the tables now will take too long.


random things I learned
- java was the primary language for Android development for many years
- but kotlin is standard now (officially recommended by google)
