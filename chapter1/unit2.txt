The cycle of change is extremely fast in the IT industry.
And at the same time, both customer and company requirements change very quickly.
Therefore, rather than aiming for a perfect plan and execution, it's wiser to focus on core features, release the product quickly, and gradually improve it over time.

All workers in IT industry have to be able to communicate to each other in order to make the service better.
All workers include Planner, Designer and even CEO and so on.


Imagine you’re running a repair shop.
One day, a customer brings in a bicycle and asks you to replace a sticker on it.
It seems like a simple task just to peel off the old sticker and put on a new one.
But once you actually start, you realize that the sticker doesn’t come off cleanly.
At first, you didn’t know this and told the customer it would only take 10 minutes.
In reality, the job ends up taking an hour.
Therefore, “When will it be done?” is always a difficult question to answer.


Developer:
Ah, the server is supposed to send the image URL, but I think the API isn't fully implemented yet.
It looks like only the icon URL is missing from the JSON…
If the icon URL isn’t provided, I set it to show a default value.
But since I made it up arbitrarily, it might look a bit odd.

Planner:
Oh, then the client side is almost done.
I’ll talk to the backend developer.
Also, I’ll speak with the designer and decide on a default icon.
Once that’s changed, please go ahead and submit it for review right away.
